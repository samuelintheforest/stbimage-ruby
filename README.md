# stb-image ruby bindings     

Ruby binding of stb-image.h

* ### Supports: ###  
  <br>
  
  * **stbi_load** (Default image loader)
  * **stbi_load_from_memroy**
  * **stbi_load_16**
  * **stbi_loadf** (For `.hdr` images)
  * **stbi_info**
  * **stbi_image_free**
  * **stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load**
  * and more...


<br>

# Installation

* Windows:\
`gem install stbimage`

* Linux/macOs:\
`gem install stbimage`

*Note: In Windows and in Linux the gem should work immadiately 'cause we using precompiled libs (see [Usage](#Usage)). In macOs you have to compile the dynamic libary (.so) yourself (see [Compilation](#Compilation)).*

<br>

# Compilation

If you want to compile the shared libary yourself, Use the instruction below (otherwise if the gem works for you than this step is unnecessary):

1. Download sources: [stb-source](stb-source) (stb_image.h, stb_image.c)

2. Navigate to the files in terminal with `cd` 

3. Run the command in terminal (works with macOs, linux, and linux arm):
`gcc -shared -o libstb.so -fPIC stb_image.c`

4. If nothing shows up than finally you got your own `libstb.so` file what is fully compatible with your system.

5. See [Usage](#Usage) to properly load it to your program.

<br>

# Precompiled shared libs (.dll, .so)

You can find it under [dlls](lib/dlls) folder, but they are also included in the gem

<br>

# Usage

```ruby
require 'stbimage'

# When you using the precompiled shared libs. Only works with linux, arm, Windows (in macOs it doesn't work)
STBIMAGE.load_lib() 

# Although when the above function doesn't work for you for some reason (or you are using macOs), please specify arguments in .load_lib function

# 1. When your own .dll, or .so libary is at the same folder as your program. Or you wanna specify relative_path to file

# STBIMAGE.load_lib('your_name.so') 
# or
# STBIMAGE.load_lib('your_folder/your_name.so')

# 2. When your own .dll or .so file is somewhere in your storage, please specify absolute path 

# Example:
# STBIMAGE.load_lib('your_name.so', '/home/user/documents/ruby_proj/dll')


width = ' ' * 4
height = ' ' * 4
nr_channels = ' ' * 4

data = STBIMAGE.stbi_load("blue-poly.jpg", width, height, nr_channels, 0)

puts data # You can use this data in OpenGL for instance.

puts width.unpack('l')[0]
puts height.unpack('l')[0]
puts nr_channels.unpack('l')[0]
```
